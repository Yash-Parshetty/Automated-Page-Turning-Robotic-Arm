# Automated-Page-Turning-Robotic-Arm


The Automated Page-Turning Robotic Arm is a low-cost, Arduino-based automation system designed to streamline the digitization of examination papers. Traditional scanning requires a human operator to manually turn each page, which is slow, error-prone, and difficult to scale for large volumes of documents. This project solves that problem by introducing a fully automated, sensor-driven page-turning mechanism that works alongside any standard flatbed scanner.

At its core, the system uses an Arduino Uno, MG995 servo motor, and an LDR sensor to detect scan completion and trigger precise page-turning actions. A silicone-tipped arm carefully lifts and flips individual pages without causing tears, folds, or accidental multi-page turns. The design emphasizes accuracy, affordability, and ease of integration, making it suitable for educational institutions, administrative departments, and digitization labs with large scanning workloads.

This project demonstrates the integration of embedded systems, mechanical design, and automation, providing a scalable alternative to expensive commercial document feeders. The prototype achieves a page-turning accuracy of 98%, supports continuous scanning, and offers a strong foundation for future improvements such as computer vision, adaptive height adjustment, and machine learning-based movement optimization.
